      This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our
      Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of

    </p>

    <h2 class="p-3">Website Visitors</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;" class="pl-3">
      Like most website operators, YourBook collects non-personally-identifying
      information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
      available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
      and the date and time of each visitor request. YourBook's purpose in
      collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
      how YourBook's visitors use its website. From time to time, YourBook may
      release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
      publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;" class="pl-3">
      YourBook also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
      Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving
      comments on https://yourbook.netlify.app blog posts. YourBook only
      discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
      circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
      information as described below.

    <h2 class="p-3">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;" class="pl-3">
      Certain visitors to YourBook's websites choose to interact with YourBook
      in ways that require YourBook to gather personally-identifying
      information. The amount and type of information that YourBook gathers
      depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who
      sign up for a blog at https://yourbook.netlify.app to provide a username
      and email address.
    </p>

    <h2 class="p-3">Security</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;" class="pl-3">
      The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember
      that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
      storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable
      means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its
      absolute security.
